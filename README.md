# havoc2nginx
havoc2nginx is a simple python script that converts Havoc Framework's yaotl malleable c2 profile to Nginx configuration file format. Most of the code and the configuration of this project came from the cs2modrewrite project (https://github.com/threatexpress/cs2modrewrite) from Joe Vest and Andrew Chiles. All credits to them.
